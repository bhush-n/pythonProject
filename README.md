# Python codes for a refresher

## What is Python?
Python is a high quality, versatile, and powerfully written programming language. Developed by Guido van Rossum, it was first released in 1991. Python is known for its readability, simplicity and ease of use, making it popular for beginners and pros mature as well, here are some of the basic characteristics of Python and how to use it.

1. **Legibility and Ease**: Python syntax is designed to be clear and readable, making it easy to learn and write code quickly.

2. **Versatility**: Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be used for a wide range of applications including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, artificial intelligence , machine learning, automation, and more

3. **Large Standard Library**: Python provides a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and functions for different tasks, making it easy to do common programming tasks without having to write everything from scratch

4. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed by an interpreter, allowing rapid development and testing without the need for compilation.

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python is available on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to write code that can run on different operating systems

6. **Community and 3rd Party Libraries**: Python has a large active team of developers, offering a large ecosystem of 3rd party libraries and frameworks that extend its powerful models and Django and Flask for web development, NumPy and pandas for data analysis, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning .

7. **Indentation-Based Syntax**: Python uses whitespace (indentation) to define blocks of code, which enforce clea
